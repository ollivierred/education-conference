							Empower Higher Education, Establish Public Private Partnership
						</h1>
						<p class="left-aligned">
							Higher Education has played an important role in the process of joining to the global processes and integrating to the global production network. Shift to the knowledge-based economy has increased the need for the highly qualified labor, innovations, and research. At the same time, recent global financial crisis hit all economies with varying degree. This resulted in the decline of public spending on education in general, and especially, on higher education. As a result of the pressured public budgeting, the higher education institutions faced the challenges of maintaining/improving quality of learning and research, and meeting the increased demand for access to higher education with fewer resources.

							<p class="left-aligned">
Preparation: Academics and business representatives to develop their proposals (business offers and academic offers) for particular business-university contracts.
Defining Risk and Risk management methods: some basic theory to be presented as "instructions".-U2B face-to-face negotiations: each participant should have at least 2-4 meetings with other representatives to match their offers. -Results: some of the participants will be invited to present the offers, approved from the academics and business representatives. Outcomes: academics to feel that "be entrepreneurial brings more opportunities for development, than just to wait".

Entrepreneurial approach in Higher Education through internationalisation and transnational education (TNE)
                            </h2>
							<p class="left-aligned">
As the levels of financial support for universities decrease around the world, there is an increasing pressure for institutions to become more entrepreneurial and forward looking. This coupled with growing international pressure and competition from other providers has led to a number of flexible opportunities using internationalisation as the main drive.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-aligned">                                
Internationalisation continues to be on the agenda of many education providers worldwide. It has significance for the contribution that HE makes to the development of a nation, its people; and its ability to compete in a global market. It is integral to economic well-being, driven and enabled by liberalisation of the international trade.
                            </p> 
                            <p class="left-aligned">
Internationalisation and transnational education in higher education are life changing and allow for better quality and diversity of academic programmes. Despite its growing importance, for many HE practitioners these are still messy concepts. They are variously interpreted and they often build upon narrow preconceptions limited to international student recruitment and foreign fees.
                            </p>
                            <p class="left-aligned">
This interactive workshop is looking at different ways of creating “cross-border” access to international education through various means, such as international recruitment, foreign campuses, student and staff mobility, progression arrangements, on-line provision, Summer Schools, work placements, franchised arrangements and validations, to name just a few. It refers to a number of examples of good practice from Coventry University in the UK, which has been actively expanding its transnational education activities for many years. Through a number of activities, we will create a discussion about the role of internationalisation and consider different transnational opportunities, asses their level of risk, advantages and disadvantages.

                            </h2>
							<p class="left-aligned">
Higher education is a key sector for the use of PPP in Europe and there are increasing number of PPP projects being launched. The workshop aims to present and assess the current role of public private partnerships in delivering public services in the higher education sector and their potential future role in doing so. It will address economic, financial, operational and legal considerations and will provide with a practical overview of the legal framework and contractual structures applied in Europe for PPP projects. The objective of the workshop is to provide a practical experience in the process of planning and procuring PPP in the higher education sector. The workshop will include a presentation and discussion of experience of PPP projects. The style of the workshop will be interactive to ensure the widest possible exchange of experiences and perspectives.
